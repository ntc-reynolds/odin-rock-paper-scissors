# odin-rock-paper-scissors

This is my take on a simple rock paper scissors game as outlined in The Odin Project. Everything was (poorly) written by hand.

## Features

- Play a classic game of Rock Paper Scissors against the computer.
- The game keeps track of scores for both the player and the computer.
- The game ends when either the player or the computer reaches 5 points.
- After a game ends, you can immediately start a new one by selecting a choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/ntc-reynolds/odin-rock-paper-scissors
   \`\`\`
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   \`\`\`bash
   cd odin-rock-paper-scissors
   \`\`\`
3. Open the \`index.html\` file in your browser to play the game.

## Usage

- Once the game is loaded in the browser, simply click on either "Rock," "Paper," or "Scissors."
- The computer will randomly choose one of the options as well.
- The result of the round will be displayed, and the scores will be updated.
- The game continues until either the player or the computer reaches 5 points. Once the game ends, a new game will automatically start when a new selection is made.
